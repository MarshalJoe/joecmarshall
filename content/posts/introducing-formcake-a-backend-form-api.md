üç∞ [Formcake](https://formcake.com) was made to solve a simple but common problem: You have a contact form, lead page, or survey, but you don't want to spin up an entire server just to field that one form's submissions.

Enter Formcake - you sign up, create a form, and get an endpoint that looks like `formcake.com/api/forms/<YOUR_FORM_ID/submissions` that you can put into your `<form>` tag's `action` endpoint.

You can then configure success and error redirects if you want them, or just have the user stay on the current page - or you can incorporate an AJAX call to submit the form and display your own success / error message.

Once it receives a submission, [Formcake](https://formcake.com) can trigger an email notification or custom webhook or Zapier integration to coordinate with the rest of your workflow - email your sales team about a new lead, send a slack message to a user researcher about a completed survey, or something else - or just store it for later.

We're not out just quite yet, but if it sounds interesting we'd love interested potential users to sign up on our [landing page](https://formcake.com) where we'll be posting updates and exclusive invites to our closed beta.

Hope to see you there!
