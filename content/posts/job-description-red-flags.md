The following aren't pulled from any specific listings because these types of awfulness transcend the individual - and because that would be dickish. But their spirit should ring true to anyone in the trenches of the job search process.

### "Wordpress Developer - Degree + 10 years experience required"

There's a certain amount of inflation to be expected when it comes to job requirements. Rigorous compiler work is not a prerequisite for building a shopify theme. In addition to being a potential tell for a demanding workplace culture in general - or a complete lack of technical understanding on the part of leadership - inflated expectations can set you up for failure.

### "PHP Contractor - 2 Months"

Short, time-bound, contracts can be a great stepping stone for a young developer, or a good stint for a freelancer looking to focus on one project for a while, but they can also be sources of ennervating, aggravating legacy work. And the presence of a lot of contractors employed on short terms can also be indicative of a short-termist culture.

### "Early Stage Employee / Technical Co-founder / Person to Make My Thing"

Being a technical co-founder or "First Engineer" often means that someone has a brilliant, unicorn-level idea and they just need that tiny part of the entire product / platform / paradigm-shifting technology to be built by someone technical (like you). Ideas are incredibly cheap. Don't invest significant effort unless there's compelling market validation, great compensation, or both.

### "Technologies: Coldfusion + jQuery"

Your job search shouldn't be driven by what's fashionable in tech, but popularity and the market for a skill *are* important factors, since they influence a career track's employability and profitability. The market for Coldfusion devs isn't too hot (or even a thing). Companies advertising outdated stacks open you up to the risk of going down a career cul de sac.

### Must Know HTML"

There's a risk working on an outdated stack and there's also a risk working with technologies that are too that don't challenge you or incite growth. Creating pixel-perfect markup is absolutely an incredible skill that takes time, attention, and craft, but writing HTML and CSS is also becoming a commoditized task thanks to having one of the lowest barriers to entry in the larger ecosystem of web application development work. It might be a great handhold into more dev work, but it's hard to use it to differentiate yourself later in your career.
