All three of the major cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) offer a free tier.

It might not be the marketing thunderbolt of BOGO (Buy One, Get One Free) or the eureka moment of the first coupon, but the AWS free tier - a cost-free class of usage defined by credits or limits that does not expire - has quietly reshaped common sense ideas about cloud pricing.

But putting aside the success of the tactic as a sales gambit, which is considerable, it offers developers an intriguing possibility - no-cost infrastructure: The prospect of a an open source interface wired to a within-free-usage-threshold server or S3 bucket, reading from and writing to a free data store.

Of course the threshold limits make the types of projects that could benefit confined to toys or side projects. If you're moving a large production load from a dedicated provider or cloud competitor, the free tiers won't have much of an impact on your decision making.

But if you're deciding to develop a side project, or bootstrapping a business from the ground up, you might want to consider the benefits of an all free-tier stack - extending beyond the big three cloud providers to services like Netlify, Mailchimp, and the myriad other SaaS and infrastructure businesses that offer free usage within certain parameters.

In fact - the free tier has much more to offer from an architectural, logistics, and business operations point of view than just not-costing-money.

In the end, being free might be the _least interesting_ thing about it.

## Definitions

There are several advantages to developing against the free stack (patent pending patent pending patent-...) that go beyond the "being free part" but first I should define what the free stack is - what qualifies a tool or technology or service for inclusion.

```
The Free Stack is comprised of all services or products that can be consumed indefinitely for free.
```


This definition doesn't mean unlimited consumption and it doesn't mean forever (sales promotions and marketing tactics change) but it does mean it's not a one shot deal ("100 credits this one time"). The word "consumption" also considers the parameterized nature of the free services. It's not "You get free X" but rather, "You get a free amount/level/quantity of X."

So what's included? Well, a bunch of stuff.

AWS, GCP, Azure, offer free tiers for various cloud services and add-ons.
Netlify is free for its core hosting services and tiers of addons.
Mailchimp is free for lists under 2,000.
Heroku provides free hosting services under certain thresholds.

And more.

## Advantages

So what are these advantages? Why should you develop on the Free Stack (TM)?

### It's scaleable.

### It promotes a larger community.
